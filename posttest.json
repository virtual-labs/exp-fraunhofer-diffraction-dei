      "question": "1. In a Fraunhofer diffraction experiment, what does the order (k) in the formulas refer to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The number of diffracting objects used",
        "b": "The color of the light source",
        "c": "The specific type of material used for the aperture",
        "d": "The location of a particular bright or dark fringe relative to the central maximum"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "Correct. The order (k) refers to the position of bright/dark fringes. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_diffraction'>here</a>"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "difficulty": "beginner"

      "question": "2. A single slit diffracts white light. Which of the following colors will deviate the most from the straight-through direction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Red",
        "b": "Green",
        "c": "Blue",
        "d": "All colors will diffract the same amount"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct. Blue has the shortest wavelength, so it diffracts the most. <a href='https://www.doubtnut.com/qna/31678260'>here</a>"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",

      "question": "3. In Fraunhofer diffraction at a single slit, what is the condition for the first minimum?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "a·sinθ = λ",
        "b": "a·cosθ = λ/2",
        "c": "d·sinθ = mλ",
        "d": "a·tanθ = λ"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The condition for first minimum is a·sinθ = λ, where a is slit width and λ is wavelength."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "4. What happens to the central maximum when the slit width is reduced in single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It becomes narrower",
        "b": "It becomes wider",
        "c": "It disappears",
        "d": "It remains unchanged"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. Reducing slit width increases diffraction, so the central maximum spreads wider."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "5. In a diffraction grating experiment, what effect does increasing the number of slits have?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The fringes become blurred",
        "b": "The fringes become sharper and more intense",
        "c": "The central maximum vanishes",
        "d": "No diffraction occurs"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. More slits increase interference sharpness, producing brighter and sharper fringes."
      },

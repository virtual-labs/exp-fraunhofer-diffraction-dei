      "question": "1. In a Fraunhofer diffraction experiment, what does the order (k) in the formulas refer to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The number of diffracting objects used",
        "b": "The color of the light source",
        "c": "The specific type of material used for the aperture",
        "d": "The location of a particular bright or dark fringe relative to the central maximum"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "Correct. The order (k) refers to the position of bright/dark fringes. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_diffraction'>here</a>"

      "question": "2. A single slit diffracts white light. Which of the following colors will deviate the most from the straight-through direction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Red",
        "b": "Green",
        "c": "Blue",
        "d": "All colors will diffract the same amount"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct. Blue has the shortest wavelength, so it diffracts the most. <a href='https://www.doubtnut.com/qna/31678260'>here</a>"

    {
      "question": "4. What happens to the central maximum when the slit width is reduced in single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It becomes narrower",
        "b": "It becomes wider",
        "c": "It disappears",
        "d": "It remains unchanged"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. Reducing slit width increases diffraction, so the central maximum spreads wider."

      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "5. In a diffraction grating experiment, what effect does increasing the number of slits have?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The fringes become blurred",
        "b": "The fringes become sharper and more intense",
        "c": "The central maximum vanishes",
        "d": "No diffraction occurs"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. More slits increase interference sharpness, producing brighter and sharper fringes."

      "question": "6. If the wavelength of light is doubled while the slit width remains constant, what happens to the angular width of the central maximum?",

        "c": "It is doubled",
        "d": "It increases four times"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The angular width is directly proportional to wavelength.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Angular width depends on wavelength.",
        "c": "Correct. The half-angular width is \u03b8 \u2248 \u03bb/d. If \u03bb doubles, the angular width doubles.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The relationship is linear, not quadratic."

      "question": "7. In the intensity distribution formula I = I\u2080(sin\u03b1/\u03b1)\u00b2, the parameter \u03b1 is equal to:",

        "d": "\u03c0d cos\u03b8 / \u03bb"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. \u03b1 = \u03c0d sin\u03b8 / \u03bb. At minima, \u03b1 = k\u03c0 (integer multiples of \u03c0), giving zero intensity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. A factor of 2 would shift the minima positions.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The \u03c0 factor is essential to match the physical positions of minima.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It uses sin\u03b8, not cos\u03b8."

      "question": "8. At the first minimum of single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction, the path difference between waves from the two edges of the slit is:",

        "d": "3\u03bb/2"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. \u03bb/2 path difference gives constructive interference in two-slit setup.",
        "b": "Correct. The condition for the first minimum is d sin\u03b8 = \u03bb, meaning the path difference between rays from opposite edges is exactly one wavelength.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 2\u03bb corresponds to the second minimum.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 3\u03bb/2 corresponds to a secondary maximum."

        "d": "\u03b8 = arcsin(3\u03bb/2d)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. arcsin(2\u03bb/d) gives the angular position of the second minimum.",
        "b": "Correct. The first minimum occurs at d sin\u03b8 = \u03bb, so \u03b8 = arcsin(\u03bb/d) defines the half-angular width of the central maximum.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would give a narrower central maximum than actually observed.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 3\u03bb/2d corresponds to the first secondary maximum."

        "d": "0.072\u00b0"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This corresponds to d = 0.20 mm with \u03bb = 500 nm.",
        "b": "Correct. sin\u03b8 = \u03bb/d = 500\u00d710\u207b\u2079 / 0.10\u00d710\u207b\u00b3 = 0.005, so \u03b8 = arcsin(0.005) \u2248 0.286\u00b0.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This over-estimates the angle by a factor of 2.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This value is too small."

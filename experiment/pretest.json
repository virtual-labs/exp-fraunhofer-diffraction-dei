      "question": "2. In Fraunhofer diffraction, what is the key characteristic of the light source and observation screen?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They are located very close to the diffracting object",
        "b": "The light source is a point source, and the screen is placed at the focal point of a lens",
        "c": "The light source is distant, and the screen is placed far away from the diffracting object.",
        "d": "The light source is monochromatic, and the screen is highly reflective."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1 ",
        "b": "Explanation 2",

      "question": "3. In Fraunhofer diffraction at a single slit, what determines the angular position of the first minimum?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Slit width and wavelength of light",
        "b": "Distance between the slit and the screen",
        "c": "Intensity of the light source",
        "d": "Refractive index of the medium"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Condition for first minimum: a·sinθ = λ, where a is slit width.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Distance affects size of pattern, not the angular position of minima.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Intensity changes brightness, not position of minima.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Medium affects wavelength, but in air it is negligible."

      "question": "4. What happens to the central maximum in single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction when the slit width is reduced?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The central maximum becomes narrower",
        "b": "The central maximum becomes wider",
        "c": "The central maximum disappears",
        "d": "The central maximum remains unchanged"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Narrower slit gives broader diffraction pattern.",
        "b": "Correct. Narrower slit increases diffraction angle, making central maximum wider.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Central maximum never disappears.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Pattern changes with slit width."

      "correctAnswer": "b",

    {
      "question": "5. In a diffraction grating experiment, what happens when the number of slits is increased?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The fringes become blurred",
        "b": "The fringes become sharper and more intense",
        "c": "The central maximum vanishes",
        "d": "No diffraction occurs"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. More slits do not blur the fringes.",
        "b": "Correct. Increasing slits increases interference, making fringes sharp and bright.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Central maximum is always present.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Diffraction always occurs with slits."
